**"I have always felt most fulfilled when I have contributed some part - major or minor - in helping others achieve their goals" ~ Kevin Zhang**


A passionate and dynamic individual who is on the road to building and challenging the norms. A data enthusiast whose intent is to bridge the gap between data-driven and intuition-driven decision-making. I have been known for producing high-quality deliverables and bringing reliability to the table. And lastly, a Lifelong learner committed to driving positive change.

**A lit intro about me**

On the day of my final high school table tennis match my determination to secure a position in the tournament fueled my resolve to win. I had dedicated countless hours of hard work and unwavering commitment for that day.

Through careful planning, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of my opponents, and having faith in my abilities, I stepped onto the court. For now, let's focus on describing myself and setting aside the outcome of the match. I am resilient, determined, hardworking, passionate about the things I love, and a dynamic individual.

Technology has always captivated my interest, whether it's the innovation of Apple's iPhone or, the internet for the matter of fact that has changed our life ever seen. The sheer power of emerging technologies never fails to astonish me. I pursued a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering for that very reason.

During my studies, I discovered the realms of machine learning and data science, which sparked a desire to leverage my analytical skills and turn them into a career. I have nurtured a curiosity to delve deeper into the field and understand how businesses utilize it. To further my research and personal growth, I decided to pursue a Master of Science in Information Systems Managementâ€”a perfect blend of technology and business.

Being the first generation in my family to come to the United States and pursue my dreams has been an incredible journey. Undertaking a challenging Master's program in a completely new country required me to start from scratch and overcome numerous obstacles. Despite these challenges, I have made significant progress and am on track to complete my degree.

I have had the privilege of uplifting and inspiring my peers and friends, actively supporting them in staying focused on their goals, and encouraging their perseverance. Witnessing others shine and succeed brings me immense joy.

To contribute to the data science community, I actively engage in volunteer and leadership roles. Presently, I am involved with the Data Science Women's community, where I contribute to the development of an empowered network of women interested in the field of data.

These experiences highlight my ability to thrive in challenging situations and emphasize my compassion and desire to contribute to the success of those around me. Moreover, I won the match, and my team secured the second position in that tournament. When considering all these aspects together, it becomes evident that I am an achiever who strives for excellence and a lifelong learner committed to accomplishing my goals.
